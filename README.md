# **HELLO WORLD**

In This Repository, You'll see some of The Famous or Easiest Computer Program _Hello World!_ . It is Known as the first example in nearly every programming language for every programmer. It is Nothing but The First example of any programming language to learn the basics of Any Programming Language. As a function, the computer program simply tells the computer to display the words “Hello, World!” Traditionally, it’s the first program developers use to test systems. For programmers, seeing the two words on the screen means their code can compile, load, run and they can see the output on the screen. It’s a test, signifying a start to a program. Over the past several decades, it’s grown to become a time-honored tradition.  All programmers that have come before you have, at some point, felt the same rush of adrenaline after realizing they successfully communicated through the computer.

Brian Kernighan, author of one of the most widely read programming books, "C Programming Language", actually wrote/created "Hello, World" program as part of the documentation for the BCPL programming language developed by Martin Richards. He first referenced ‘Hello World’ in the C Programming Language book’s predecessor: A Tutorial Introduction to the Programming Language B published in 1973.

```bcpl

let Main() be

The Actual use of Hello World programs is a way for rookie coders to become acquainted with a new language. However, the applications of these programs go beyond an introduction to the coding world. Hello World can be used as a sanity test to make sure that the components of a language (its compiler, development and run-time environment) have been correctly installed. Because the process involved in configuring a complete programming toolchain is lengthy and complex, a simple program like Hello World is often used as a first-run test on a new toolchain.

Hackers also use Hello World “as proof of concept that arbitrary code can be executed through an exploit where the system designers did not intend code to be executed,” according to programming consultants at Cunningham & Cunningham (C2). In fact, it’s the first step in using homemade content, or “home brew” on a device. When experienced coders opens in new window are configuring an environment or learning a previously unknown one, they verify that Hello World behaves correctly.

It is also used as part of the debugging process, allowing programmers to check that they are editing the right aspect of a modifiable program at runtime and that it is being reloaded.

One more popular use for Hello World is as a basis for comparison. Coders can “compare the size of the executable that the language generates, and how much supporting infrastructure must exist behind the program for it to execute,” according to C2’s wiki.
